## How to Use

Install all packages listed in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/lloyd-axe/magichand/blob/master/requirements.txt).
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then, just simply create a new magichand instance and use its **activate** method.

```python
mh = magichand()
mh.activate()
```

## Possible improvements
Planning to add more flexible options in future version.
